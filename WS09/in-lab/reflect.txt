1. Source code will not compile if the definition for a template is in Data.cpp

2. Template declarations are only permitted at global, namespace, or class
scope & a function must be declared before it is called.

3. I could have done the lab with overloading functions but this would have
involved duplicating a lot of code. The advantage of templates is to avoid
code duplication.

4. template<class T> makes a template for a class and typename for a function
but can be used interchangeably.

5. I have learned that templates are a type of parametric polymorphism which is
a type of universal polymorphism.
