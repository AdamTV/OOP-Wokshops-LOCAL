REFLECTION SECTION (I WILL WORK ON POINT FORM)
I have learnt from completing this workshop that C++ is a beautiful program-
ming language. The purpose of namespaces are for scope resolution and save us
from using the scope resolution operator every time we want to call a
function from an included module. They are also used to group our code by
logic and prevent name collisions when using multiple libraries. Header files
allow us to include definitions of functions and variables that are contained
in the module they are a part of. This is just enough information that the
compiler needs to validate the function. They are important because they
allow us to share information between modules without having to recompile
said information. On big projects this probably improves efficiency of the
program. Header files should not be compiled because they contain just enough
information for the compiler to validate functions you will be using and the
definitions they include already exist in the corresponding .cpp file.
Including .cpp files in other files would compile the same file twice and
that takes up twice as much memory when you don't need to. The purpose of
header files is to negate the need to include your .cpp files in other .cpp
files.

QUIZ 1 REFLECTION
- The answer I got wrong was describing shadowing in respect to scope.
- I said it occurs when a pre-defined variable gets defined again within the
same block of code
- The correct answer is the inner block of code, I must respect the scope!
