REFLECTION
I selected the long long type for isbn because the value of a long long is at
least 64 bits.
I would put validation logic in a constructor to avoid changing anything to the
Book::set function if an update to the validation logic was necessary.
The thing that took me the most time was the validation logic for the isbn.
It was difficult to implement my logic especially because I had a hard time
understanding what I was trying to implement.

QUIZ 3 REFLECTION
The question I got wrong asked if the compiler does not insert an empty-body no
argument constructor into a class definition that declares any form of
constructor. I said this was false but it is true, the compiler does no such
thing.
