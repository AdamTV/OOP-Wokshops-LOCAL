WORKSHOP 5 REFLECTION
The operator+ returns a Fraction object because it only calculates the sum of 2
fractions. It does not need to return a reference to an object because unlike
the operator+=, + does not reassign a value to an existing object, and only
needs to return a copy.
I included a bothEmpty function that accepted an unmodifiable reference to a
Fraction object as a parameter and reused my functions multiple times to
minimize code duplication.
