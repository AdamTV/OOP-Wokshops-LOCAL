In this workshop I have learned how to reuse code in 2 different ways.
1. Calling default constructor on *this to set a safe empty state.
2. Using a set function to only set all the values  of the passed arguments to
the current object while keeping validation logic in constructors.

A safe empty state is/are (a) value(s) that is/are used by member functions to
check the state of an object. The safe empty state cannot be redefined and is
used to ensure proper functionality of functions.

The canTravelWith() function can access the private data of the object
referenced in it's parameter because all member functions can access private
data members of the same class.
