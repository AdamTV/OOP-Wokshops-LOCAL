REFLECTION
- I learnt the value of thoroughness
- I had properly implemented the overloaded display function (I think) but
forgot to change the declaration in the header file which took me an hour to find
- This workshop is titled Dynamic Memory however I have learnt more about
overloaded functions and the value of thoroughness.
- We allocate new dynamic memory for entire array when increasing size because
dynamic memory is allocated contiguously and it makes logical sense to have all
elements of an object stored contiguously.
- We don't need to use the delete operator on the model of a structure because
the model of the CellPhone structure is stored in a header file and does not get
compiled in the first place. Memory for the array of cellphones is allocated
dynamically according to how many cellphones there are. This is done to save
memory.
- The compiler knows which display function to call based on the arguments you
specify in your call to the function, and it's definitions and prototypes of
that function in both the header file and .cpp file! I learnt this the hard way.

QUIZ REFLECTION
-The question I got wrong was the purpose of the const qualifier after a
function declaration
- The purpose of the const qualifier is to set the function as a query which is
only able to read data members it receives.
