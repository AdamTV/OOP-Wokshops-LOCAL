WORKSHOP 8 REFLECTION BY: ADAM STINZIANI

An abstract base class contains or inherits at least one pure virtual
function. For this reason abstract base classes are instantiable.
In contrast, concrete classes contain implementations and can be instantiated.

 The main module can work with all of the accounts because it accesses them
 through the CreateAccount function that is in the Allocator module, which
 contains the header files for the accounts.

 The destructor is necessary in the interface because this ensures that the
 most derived class's destructor will get called first which in turn ensures
 all of the destructors in the hierarchy will be called when an object is
 deleted.

 Overloading occurs when multiple functions within a derived and base class
 share the same identifier. Shadowing occurs when a derived function with the
 same signature is called instead of the base. Overriding occurs when a derived
 class uses scope resolution to specify from which class it wants to execute an
 overloaded method.

 2. The purpose of a constrained cast is to convert a variable from one data
 type to another to get code to work that would not have in the first place.
