WORKSHOP 7 REFLECTION BY: ADAM STINZIANI

1. The Hero class does not need to know about the SuperHero class because it is
the base class.
2. The SuperHero class does need to know about the Hero class because it is the
derived class.
3. When a SuperHero fought a Hero it printed out "Ancient Battle!". I think it
used the Hero * Hero operator because even though I did not define a Hero *
SuperHero operator, all SuperHeros are Heros and can therefore use the Hero
operator.

In this workshop I learned the value of early binding, dynamic dispatch and
overriding dynamic dispatch with early binding. I also learned that public
member functions of derived classes cannot access private data members of their
base class.
